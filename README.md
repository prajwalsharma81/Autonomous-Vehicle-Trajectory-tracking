# Trajectory Tracking of Autonomous Vehicle Using PID Control

## Overview
This project explores the implementation of a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm to maintain accurate path trajectory tracking in autonomous vehicles. By leveraging the simplicity and effectiveness of PID control, the system dynamically adjusts the steering angle based on the difference between the desired path and the current position, ensuring the vehicle adheres to the predefined path with minimal error.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust and efficient path trajectory system for autonomous vehicles using PID control.
- Simulate the vehicle's movement and path tracking capabilities using Python.
- Validate the efficacy of the PID control system through comprehensive testing and analysis under various conditions.

## Features
- **PID Control Algorithm**: Implemented in Python to control vehicle steering and maintain trajectory accuracy.
- **Simulation Environment**: A simulated environment for testing and analyzing the control system's performance.
- **Error Minimization**: Continuous adjustment of the vehicle's steering angle to reduce deviation from the desired path.

## Motivation
The inspiration for this project stems from the increasing demand for advanced control systems in autonomous vehicles. With PID control, we aim to enhance the precision and safety of autonomous navigation in complex environments.
